#> 1:                                                                                                                                              HEN1 methyltransferase homolog 1 (Arabidopsis); Methyltransferase that adds a 2'-O-methyl group at the 3'-end of piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. This probably protects the 3'-end of piRNAs from uridylation activity and subsequent degradation. Stabilization of piRNAs is essential for gametogenesis (By similarity)
#> 2:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       asparagine-linked glycosylation 3, alpha-1,3- mannosyltransferase homolog (S. cerevisiae); Adds the first Dol-P-Man derived mannose in an alpha-1,3 linkage to Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
#> 3: telomerase reverse transcriptase; Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme essential for the replication of chromosome termini in most eukaryotes. Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- n [...] 
#> 4:                                                                                                                                                                 polymerase (DNA directed), beta; Repair polymerase that plays a key role in base-excision repair. Has 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (dRP lyase) activity that removes the 5' sugar phosphate and also acts as a DNA polymerase that adds one nucleotide to the 3' end of the arising single-nucleotide gap. Conducts 'gap-filling' DNA synthesis in a stepwise distributive fashion rather than in a processive fashion as for other DNA polymerases
#> 5:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         N-myristoyltransferase 2; Adds a myristoyl group to the N-terminal glycine residue of certain cellular proteins (By similarity)
#> 6:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, CCA-adding, 1; Isoform 1: Adds and repairs the conserved 3'-CCA sequence necessary for the attachment of amino acids to the 3' terminus of tRNA molecules, using CTP and ATP as substrates
